          <strong>Where we met — 2026-01-06</strong>
          <p>It all started on an ordinary day, one of those days that seem nothing special… until fate had other plans. I was on my way to the supermarket, my mind full of errands, when suddenly… there you were.

I remember seeing you there, standing by the roadside. And just like that, something inside me stirred. I don’t know if it was the way you smiled, or the way the sunlight caught your hair, or maybe it was just you—but I was completely captivated. That moment, brief as it was, felt like the universe whispering, “Pay attention. Something beautiful is about to begin.”

From that first glance, I felt an undeniable pull. I wanted to know you, to understand every little thing that made you… you. And as our paths began to cross more and more, I realized that attraction was just the beginning. Every laugh we shared, every conversation we had, made me fall deeper—faster—than I ever thought possible.

Looking back now, that roadside encounter seems almost magical. A tiny moment in time that changed my world forever. You walked into my life, and suddenly, the ordinary became extraordinary. Every memory since then has been colored by the joy, warmth, and love you bring.

Today, I want you to know that that first spark on the roadside has grown into something so much bigger. Something lasting. Something I can’t imagine my life without. And every day, I am grateful that fate decided to place you right there… at that exact moment, on that ordinary day that became unforgettable.</p>
